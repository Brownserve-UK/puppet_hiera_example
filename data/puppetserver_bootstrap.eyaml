# This will get a Puppet server bootstrapped when using the puppet-server.ps1 script in Puppet-Provisioning.
# This should be pretty generic - enough to get Puppet going, the key things to change here are the puppet version and puppet environment.
# On the production branch these should be set to the stable things for bootstrapping a new Puppet server in a pinch, for a testing branch these can be set to whatever you want.
